### 791. Custom Sort String

S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.

S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.

Return any permutation of T (as a string) that satisfies this property.

**Example :**

    Input: 
    S = "cba"
    T = "abcd"
    Output: "cbad"
    Explanation: 
    "a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
    Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
  
 **Note:**

- S has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in S.
- T has length at most 200.
- S and T consist of lowercase letters only.


### First
此题可根据排序模式串S中，每个字符的相对索引位置进行排序，索引位置小的排在前面
索引位置大的排在后面，不在S中的可默认赋-1或者26，将其放在最前或者最后。
时间复杂度O(len(T)loglen(T)) -> O(nlogn)
```python
class Solution(object):
    def customSortString(self, S, T):
        """
        :type S: str
        :type T: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        self.letter_dict = {c: -1 for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'}
        self.letter_dict.update({c: i for i, c in enumerate(S)})

        # def compare(a, b):
        #     if

        return "".join(sorted(T, key=lambda x: self.letter_dict[x]))


s = Solution()
print(s.customSortString('cba', 'abcdefg'))
```
