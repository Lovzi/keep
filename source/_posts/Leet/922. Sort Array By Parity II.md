##
Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.

Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
 
```

**Note:**

- 2 <= A.length <= 20000
- A.length % 2 == 0
- 0 <= A[i] <= 1000


### Answer
```python
class Solution(object):
    def sortArrayByParityII(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        odd = 1
        even = 0
        result = A[:]
        for a in A:
            if a % 2:
                result[odd] = a
                odd += 2
            else:
                result[even] = a
                even += 2

        return result

s = Solution()
print(s.sortArrayByParityII([4,5,6,7]))
```
